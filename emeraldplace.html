							<h1>Emerald Place Project</h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Project Outline Statement</h2>
								<p>In November 2023, SABP opened a new 12 bed inpatient unit for young people, known as Emerald Place Clinic in partnership with Elysium Healthcare. This project provided a digital EPR solution using SystmOne for the new CAMHS Tier 4 inpatient unit that was used by both SABP and Elysium staff at Emerald Place. Using SystmOne as Emerald Place’s EPR ensures a single electronic patient record that can be accessed and updated by all SABP Services providing care to a Young Person throughout the CAMHS care pathway. This new SystmOne Inpatient solution also provided the blueprint to roll out new SystmOne units to other SABP Inpatient Services in future, as part of the Adapt+ programme.</p>
								<p>The new digital solution using SystmOne was developed to support the new CAMHS Tier 4 Inpatient Service and integration with existing SABP CAMHS pathways. Using SystmOne as a solution ensures the recording of information accurately & easily, creating an efficient workflow for staff. SystmOne provides a trusted, safe and secure EPR platform which ensures good data quality from service launch and fulfills national data compliance requirements.</p>
							<h3>Date & Duration:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>January 2023 - June 2023 (Development & Prototype Build)</li>
								</ul>
							
							<hr>
							
							<h2>Research Artifacts</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Research Sessions were held with the CAMHS Tier 4 Provider Collaborative to understand their current ways of working and the potential changes once Emerald Place opens</li>
									<li>Participated in operationally led workshop to discuss changes to the referral process for Emerald Place, including how referrals of non-Surrey Young People will be handled</li>
									<li>Due to there not being an outlined stakeholder or future product audience/user we had to be flexible and intuitive with who we developed the project alongside. This included working with private organisations and other areas of Surrey and Borders where individuals could reflect the future users of the Emerald Place solution.</li>
								</ul>
							
								<h3>User Personas</h3>	
									<p>User Personas were gathered by research staff to understand the needs, requirements and pain points of the future users of the Emerald Place system.</p>
										<span class="image small"><img src="images/EmeraldPlaceUserPersona.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>User Journey Maps</h3>
									<p>Journey maps were also created to understand the pathway of the user. As Emerald Place is a new inpatient unit there are a number of different clinical roles to understand and unpack. Journey maps help deliver this information to the designer.</p>
										<span class="image small"><img src="images/EmeraldPlaceUserJourneyMaps.jpg" width="350" alt="" /></span>
							
							<hr>
							
							<h2>Project Goals & Challenges</h2>
							<h3>Pain Points</h3>
							<ul>
  								<li>The Service is not yet established so operational processes are not yet defined and staff are not in post</li>
  								<li>SABP has not operated a CAMHS Tier 4 GAU ward before, so there is little internal experience to leverage</li>
  								<li>Inpatient Services need a wide range of EPR features and functionality, resulting in a large scope for the Minimum Viable Product</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Goals</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Enables the launch of a new CAMHS Tier 4 Inpatient Unit, allowing Young People to be treated closer to their home & community</li>
								<li>The new EPR will provide a secure and efficient way to record and view all aspects of Inpatient care provided, aligning with Clinical & Operational models</li>
								<li>The new EPR is expected to fit with the CAMHS Care Pathway (from referral to discharge) and will allow other SABP Services to easily access patient data recorded during admission</li>
								<li>It will support the Surrey Heartlands CAMHS Tier 4 Provider Collaborative to refer to Emerald Place for admission and give visibility of capacity</li>
								<li>A new SystmOne solution will ensure that the Service can record information accurately & easily, creating an efficient workflow for staff</li>
								<li>The new EPR will ensure safe storage of information and will provide a single source of truth for patient</li>
								<li>Due to efficient workflow, staff will have more time available for patient care, enabling better patient outcomes</li>
								<li>It will support both the mandatory National reporting requirements and internal reporting needs for both SABP and Elysium</li>
								<li>The use of the SystmOne implementation will act as a blueprint to roll out new SystmOne units to other SABP Inpatient Services as part of the Adapt+ programme</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>SystmOne out of the box</h2>
									<video class="video" src="images/s1outoftheboxwalkthrough.mp4" width="900" controls autoplay muted ></video>
								<p>The video above displays the out of the box functionality provided by SystmOne.  Without any design team intervention this is what can be configured within the system. The main drawbacks are as follows: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Information is unclear and unstructured; buttons and clinical information can be easily missed and unnoticed. This design presents a clinical risk as patient information can be easily ignored or missed.</li>
										<li>When developments are applied screens can get busy and unusable very quickly. There is no awareness of design principles or designing for the benefit of the user.</li>
										<li>There is no consideration for Information Architecture (where information sits and why it logically sits there).</li>
										<li>Designs are not accessible, making information very hard to read and understand.</li>
										<li>Actions are very hard to notice, the UI design does not support call to actions or prompting.</li>
									</ul>

								<p>The work below will show you how we develop a product and implement our work within SystmOne to completely overhaul the out of the box functionality SystmOne provides. Making for a much smoother, more comfortable, and safer user experience.</p>
							
							<hr>
							
							<h2>My Role & Contribution</h2>
							<ul>

							<h1>Alpha Phase</h1>
				
									<h3>Architecture Maps</h3>
										<p>Architecture Maps were developed to map out the information required for the electronic patient record system. Mapping in this way allowed for the designers to funnel information into specific areas efficiently. This in turn would help improve the user experience as information would be stored logically, helping users both record and analyse information efficiently.</p>
											<span class="image small"><img src="images/emeraldplacesitemap.png" alt="" /></span>

									<h3>Sketches - Lo-Fi Designs</h3>
										<p>Initial lo-fi sketches were produced by designers to help map out page sets. This work produced alongside the information architecture map helped create a first look at navigation. The sketch below displays the initial draft of how information would be displayed for the clerking process. We can see a number of buttons allow clinical staff to complete clerking actions including, initial assessments, care plans, physical health checks and swabs. Aligned to the right hand side shows a view/checklist feature. The designers felt that a feature like this built within the patient record could help staff have a visual track record of what has been completed for clerking and what hasn't.</p>
											<span class="image small"><img src="images/EmeraldPlaceSketches.jpg" width="600" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Below you can now see how the lo-fi design has been developed further within Adobe XD to produce a functional prototype. Designers were able to use this build within co-design workshops to help give clinical users an experience to navigate the potential solution themselves. Providing a prototype that users can actually play around with provides a better chance for more in depth and meaningful feedback to be received.</p>
											<span class="image small"><img src="images/emeraldplacelofiproto.jpg" width= "600" alt="" /></span>

									<h3>How we measured Alpha Success</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Gaining signoff and approval from private provider services that reflect our future users of the Emerald Place system</li>
												<li>Completing an in depth architecture map, this would later be used to reference the entire product creation in a project reflection report</li>
												<li>Meeting the targeted deadline for prototype completion</li>
											</ul>

							<h1>Beta Phase</h1>

									<h3>Developing the MVP</h3>
										<p>Shown below is an image of the fully developed initial prototype for Admissions and Clerking. We have seen how this product has been developed from initial sketches, lo-fi prototypes and full working solutions within the electronic patient record. Users are able to enjoy a more visual experience helping navigate the various clerking tasks with the ability to view whether particular forms have been completed or not.</p>
											<span class="image small"><img src="images/emeraldplaceproto.png" width= "600" alt="" /></span>
										<p>The video click through below displays the solution in it's entirety. Users are able to navigate a design following our trust wide design system, providing a consistent visual experience. Users are also able to access various features that feed into our solution, this includes, a trust wider initial assessment, pop-up clinical tree task reminders, clinical questionnaires and automated microsoft word summary documents.</p>
											<video class="video" src="images/emeraldplaceadmissionswalkthrough.mp4" width="900" controls autoplay muted ></video>

									<h3>Planned Product Benefits</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Increase in completion speed for clinical processes</li>
											<li>Greater ease of use for clinical roles</li>
											<li>Reliable single source of truth for patient information, reducing the chance of incorrect clinical decision making</li>
											<li>Greater visibility of patient pathway progression</li>
										</ul>

							<h2>Outcome & Handover</h2>
										<p>The Emerald Place project was a great success in terms of completion of the alpha phase and development of the clerking process pages. Unfortunately, due to a change in responsibility for the inpatient service the provider the patient record changed to support the Elysium healthcare system called Care Notes. The design team therefore had to put a halt to the electronic patient record development. Even though the project came to an end, the design team was able to reuse a lot of the assets created in projects produced following Emerald Place. Our design team had also been able to set the standard for producing a new production process when making a new unit within the electronic patient record. Since the end of the project other design teams have learned from our developments and best practices.</p>

							<h2>What I learned from this project</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>How to manage staff efficiently when there are serious deadlines</li>
											<li>How to manage staff under very stressful conditions. Putting staff emotions and comfortability at the forefront. When stress is seriously heightened this takes a toll on the energy and output of staff</li>
											<li>Using support efficiently and asking the right questions</li>
