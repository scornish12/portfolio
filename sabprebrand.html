							<h1>SABP ReBranding</h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Project Outline Statement</h2>
								<h3>Background</h3>
									<p>The SABP Comms Team are looking for a rebrand to be produced that “dresses up and down” across all touchpoints of Surrey & Borders Partnership (inc. letterheads, social media material, annual reports, roller banners). This graphical device will support the material on both print and digital platforms and needs to be accessible for a wide range of users (NHS patients and staff). Designers have a role of producing mock-ups which will then be handed over to comms team members once a final decision has been made on the 5th September 2023. Following the submission of a design proposal from an external design agency, the Trust’s Communications team are assigning the same task to roles and design expertise in-house. </p>
									<p>Designers to develop a new graphical element that will work across various touchpoints. The communications team have also created a Recruitment Campaign. The designs produced in this can be used as inspiration as this displays their design direction going forward. It is preferable that each designer produces a new graphical device and displays this within two example mock-ups to show its versatility (e.g., Annual report cover, patient facing poster). The design team will be required to pitch their proposals to the communications team on the 3rd of September.</p>
									<p>Quote from Director of Comms -</p>
									<p>"The CEO is looking for something quite subtle, a graphical device that ‘dresses up and down’, i.e. can look very corporate blazoned across an Annual Report cover and can be part of the wallpaper when we want a relaxed or youthful or upbeat look and feel. ‘For a better life’ (examples of this in the recruitment campaign material) should be prominent. It can be in/with the graphical device or separate. He wants it to work with the ‘excellent work’ we did on the recruitment strategy, and we should be easily able to apply it to [at least] the front of Our Strategy.”</p>
							<h3>Date & Duration:</h3>

									<p>Trust Strapline - "For a better life"</p>
									<p>The Trust’s strapline ‘For a better life.’ is used in the recruitment campaign and would need to feature in any new branding in the same font (Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed). The designs need to reflect this strapline and ethos across all touchpoints.</p>

							<h2>Project Goals & Challenges</h2>
							<h3>Pain Points</h3>
							<ul>
  								<li>Quick turnaround, timescale of 3 weeks to research, design and present this proposal</li>
  								<li>Add more Here</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Goals</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Knowledge sharing - we're taking on more important design principles and thinking about accessibility within our designs for SystmOne. This opportunity to knowledge share with the Communications Team can benefit the relationship between the Design Team and Communications team, opening a channel for potential work in the future. </li>
								<li>This can benefit the whole user experience not just for staff in the patient record but for patient leaflets and other touchpoints that patients will directly interact with.</li>
								<li>Produce a brand identity that supports the values of the Trust and is flexible across different mediums.</li>
								<li>Support and organise a multi-disciplinary team to deliver designs with meaning that expresses the values of the Trust </li>
								<li>Provide a cost benefit to the Trust through completing this work with in-house skills and resources.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<hr>
							
							<h2>My Role & Contribution</h2>
								<p>The proposal for this design work developed following a period of consultation I had personally organised with the communications team to discuss accessibility on the trust website and colour scheme. After receiving the proposal to make a new brand identity, I drew up a business case file to explain the details, project background and approach to the Head of Design & Solutions. Once this was approved, I was able to assemble a team of UX Designers/UX Researchers with previous branding/graphic design skills to complete this project. I then proceeded to organise tasks, due dates and following up meetings to move the project forward efficiently.</p>
