							<h1>SABP ReBranding</h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Project Outline Statement</h2>
								<h3>Background</h3>
									<p>The SABP Comms Team are looking for a rebrand to be produced that “dresses up and down” across all touchpoints of Surrey & Borders Partnership (inc. letterheads, social media material, annual reports, roller banners). This graphical device will support the material on both print and digital platforms and needs to be accessible for a wide range of users (NHS patients and staff). Designers have a role of producing mock-ups which will then be handed over to comms team members once a final decision has been made on the 5th September 2023. Following the submission of a design proposal from an external design agency, the Trust’s Communications team are assigning the same task to roles and design expertise in-house. </p>
									<p>Designers to develop a new graphical element that will work across various touchpoints. The communications team have also created a Recruitment Campaign. The designs produced in this can be used as inspiration as this displays their design direction going forward. It is preferable that each designer produces a new graphical device and displays this within two example mock-ups to show its versatility (e.g., Annual report cover, patient facing poster). The design team will be required to pitch their proposals to the communications team on the 3rd of September.</p>
									<p>Quote from Director of Comms -</p>
									<p>"The CEO is looking for something quite subtle, a graphical device that ‘dresses up and down’, i.e. can look very corporate blazoned across an Annual Report cover and can be part of the wallpaper when we want a relaxed or youthful or upbeat look and feel. ‘For a better life’ (examples of this in the recruitment campaign material) should be prominent. It can be in/with the graphical device or separate. He wants it to work with the ‘excellent work’ we did on the recruitment strategy, and we should be easily able to apply it to [at least] the front of Our Strategy.”</p>
							<h3>Date & Duration:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>January 2023 - June 2023 (Development & Build)</li>

										<ul>
											<li>Treat people well</li>
											<li>Involve not ignore</li>
											<li>Create respectful places</li>
											<li>Be honest, open and accountable</li>
										</ul>
									<p>Strategic Priorities</p>

									<p>Trust Strapline - "For a better life"</p>
									<p>The Trust’s strapline is ‘For a better life.’ This is used in the recruitment campaign and would need to feature in any new branding in the same font (Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed). The designs need to reflect this strapline and ethos across all touchpoints.</p>

							<h2>Project Goals & Challenges</h2>
							<h3>Pain Points</h3>
							<ul>
  								<li>Transferring information from Excel to SystmOne takes team administrators 2hrs per day and frequently leads to overtime</li>
  								<li>Staff time for patient contact is significantly reduced due to the time taken to manually fill in SBAR information on Excel</li>
  								<li>Some HTT localities abandoned the SBAR entirely due to its strain on the service</li>
								<li>Significant Information Governance (IG) risk of storing patient information outside the EPR</li>
								<li>Significant clinical risk due to duplicated information and mixing of patient information within Excel</li>
								<li>Difficulty determining who completed each document and when</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Goals</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Support a more efficient handover process. Save time when completing the handover document and thus free up precious clinical time resulting in better patient outcomes</li>
								<li>Reduce duplication of information and remove any confusion as to which is the latest version of the SBAR</li>
								<li>Provide a single source of truth for patient data using SystmOne</li>
								<li>Safer storage of the information into the EPR, easily identifying who produced the document and when it was last updated</li>
								<li>Reduce the IG risk that comes from storing patient information outside of the EPR and ensures that all patient information is recorded against the patient record in the EPR</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>SystmOne out of the box</h2>
								<p>Include Video Here</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This video displays the out of the box functionality provided by SystmOne.  Without any design team intervention this is what can be configured within the system. The main drawbacks are as follows: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Information is unclear and unstructured; buttons and clinical information can be easily missed and unnoticed. This design presents a clinical risk as patient information can be easily ignored or missed.</li>
										<li>When developments are applied screens can get busy and unusable very quickly. There is no awareness of design principles or designing for the benefit of the user.</li>
										<li>There is no consideration for Information Architecture (where information sits and why it logically sits there).</li>
										<li>Designs are not accessible, making information very hard to read.</li>
										<li>Actions are very hard to notice, the UI design does not support call to actions or prompting.</li>
									</ul>

								<p>The work below will show you how we develop a product and implement our work within SystmOne to completely overhaul the out of the box functionality SystmOne provides. Making for a much smoother, more comfortable, and safer user experience.</p>

								<h3>Working with our support teams</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>App Support: to assist with the configuration of the new SystmOne Unit and build of the features and functionalities in SystmOne Live, ready to support the Unit after Go Live.</li>
										<li>Learning & Adoption: to provide training for all Emerald Place staff on the new Inpatient Unit, in addition to CYPS Services and the CAMHS Tier 4 Provider Collaborative Service.</li>
										<li>Digital Information Service: to understand the MHSDS reporting requirements and how these relate to the Strategic Reporting Extract from SystmOne.</li>
										<li>Information Governance: to ensure the SystmOne solution is compliant from an IG perspective and to support with the DPIA for the new Service.</li>
										<li>Digital Clinical Safety: to ensure the SystmOne solution is compliant from a Digital Clinical Safety perspective and to contribute to the approach for carrying out Digital Clinical Hazard Workshops, assessing and mitigating any risks associated with the EPR.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>This is the demo EPR and ONLY uses test patients, not live/real patient data.</p>
									<p>Our Trust uses SystmOne (Electronic patient record software) created by TPP for the NHS. Our Teams work using Agile Scrum and User Centred Design following GDS https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard</p>
