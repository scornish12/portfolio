							<h1>Reading FC: Murals & Player Promotion</h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Project Outline Statement</h2>
									<h3>Background</h3>
										<p>Throughout my teens and early twenties I have been involved with the Reading Football Club community. The connections and relationships I built over that time provided me with the opportunity to work with the club on some exciting projects. One of those was to produce a series of murals for a new stand at the Select Car Leasing Stadium. One mural would stretch across a section of the stadium to commemorate one of the clubs previous managers. I was also commissioned to create a series of three murals that would be placed in the tunnel entries into the stand. I was free to design and consider the content of these murals by gathering a collective opinion across my community connections.</p>
										<p>I was also handed a second opportunity to create a promotional media piece for a Reading FC player. This piece of media would be distributed across social network sites to promote the return of a player from injury. The design and energy of the video needed to be fast paced and energetic to reflect the player and his particular style.</p>
								<h3>Date & Duration:</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>August - October 2021 (Development & Release)</li>
									</ul>

								<h2>Project Goals & Challenges</h2>
									<h3>Pain Points</h3>
										<ul>
  											<li>Producing a design that would be printed at a great scale. At the time this is something I had never done before. Research was needed to understand best practice and appropriate scales to use in order to keep resolution and image quality consistent</li>
  											<li>There was significant pressure to make sure the mural design would be something accepted and liked by the Reading FC fanbase. The design would reflect either positively or negative on the club and myself</li>
											<li>Colour choices, the colours chosen by myself needed to be compatible for large CMYK prints. Previously, my primary experience had been in producing digital RGB designs which are generally seen to be much more forgiving in understanding how the final product will look.</li>
										</ul>
									<h3>Goals</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>To produce a design that would be embraced by the Reading FC fanbase</li>
											<li>To execute the mural brief and provide the Select Car Leasing stadium with an exciting visual design that the club can be proud of</li>
											<li>To create an exciting promotional video that improves my design software skills and produces a much more professional final product</li>
										</ul>

									<h3>Idea behind the design</h3>
										<p>producing a design that uplifts the fanbase as the club are in a difficult time</p>

								<hr>

								<h2>Mural Outcome</h2>
									<p>The final outcome proved to be very successful. The fanbase were very positive in their interaction with the murals on social media. The football club have also been regularly using the murals as a focal point on social media. In the run up to matchdays the club will promote the fixture through videos and photos of the murals.</p>
