							<h1>SABP Design System</h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Project Outline Statement</h2>
								<h3>Background</h3>
									<p>Surrey and Borders Partnership currently employs 5 different digital design teams that are aligned to a variety of clinical workstreams. Since the inception of the design teams, designers have been free to explore their own UI patterns and components in the products they have produced. While this helps provide designers with the space to be creative, it does reduce the consistency of UI design which then has an impact on user learning and experience. As a result, I have been tasked with assembling a new iterative and inclusive design system that will instil consistency into the clinical products the design teams produce. The primary objectives are to make sure the design system is easy to understand, is inclusive of all design team roles and increases design consistency and improves user experience/user learning.</p>
							<h3>Date & Duration:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>4th September 2023 - Present (Development & Release)</li>
								</ul>
							
							
							<hr>
							
							<h2>Project Goals & Challenges</h2>
							<h3>Pain Points</h3>
							<ul>
  								<li>Quick turnaround, timescale of 3 weeks to research, design and present this proposal</li>
  								<li>Add more Here</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Goals</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Knowledge sharing - we're taking on more important design principles and thinking about accessibility within our designs for SystmOne. This opportunity to knowledge share with the Communications Team can benefit the relationship between the Design Team and Communications team, opening a channel for potential work in the future. </li>
								<li>This can benefit the whole user experience not just for staff in the patient record but for patient leaflets and other touchpoints that patients will directly interact with.</li>
								<li>Produce a brand identity that supports the values of the Trust and is flexible across different mediums.</li>
								<li>Support and organise a multi-disciplinary team to deliver designs with meaning that expresses the values of the Trust </li>
								<li>Provide a cost benefit to the Trust through completing this work with in-house skills and resources.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<hr>
							
							<h2>My Role & Contribution</h2>
								<p>The proposal for this design work developed following a period of consultation I had personally organised with the communications team to discuss accessibility on the trust website and colour scheme. After receiving the proposal to make a new brand identity, I drew up a business case file to explain the details, project background and approach to the Head of Design & Solutions. Once this was approved, I was able to assemble a team of UX Designers/UX Researchers with previous branding/graphic design skills to complete this project. I then proceeded to organise tasks, due dates and follow up meetings to move the project forward efficiently.</p>

							<h2>What I learned from this project</h2>
									<h3>What I learned</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>The Design System has been released and has been used with wide success, designs are now becoming more visually consistent across multiple projects. </li>
											<li>Plans have begun to develop some research and testing of stakeholder opinion before and after the release of the design system.</li>
											<li>The agenda for the next Future Update Submission session has received a number of varied discussion points and will be held in the next couple of months. This is really positive to see as designers are responding to the design system and applying their suggestions and design knowledge.</li>
											<li>Over the next year the Design System Champions will act as coaches to help incentivise designers to use the designs collaboratively created. Design Systems take time to embed so the project will be reviewed in a year to see how project work has developed. Changes can then be made to the submission process/design system if needed.</li>
											<li>Design System Champions are meeting regularly to discuss agenda points that have been raised and any other issues that have surfaced.</li>
