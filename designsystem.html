							<h1>SABP Design System</h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Project Outline Statement</h2>
								<h3>Background</h3>
									<p>Surrey and Borders Partnership currently employs 5 different digital design teams that are aligned to a variety of clinical workstreams. Since the inception of the design teams, designers have been free to explore their own UI patterns and components in the products they have produced. While this helps provide designers with the space to be creative, it does reduce the consistency of UI design which then has an impact on user learning and experience. As a result, I have been tasked with assembling a new iterative and inclusive design system that will instil consistency into the clinical products the design teams produce. The primary objectives are to make sure the design system is easy to understand, is inclusive of all design team roles and increases design consistency and improves user experience/user learning.</p>
							<h3>Date & Duration:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>4th September 2023 - Present (Development & Release)</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Project Goals & Challenges</h2>
							<h3>Pain Points</h3>
							<ul>
  								<li>Quick turnaround, timescale of 3 weeks to research, design and present this proposal</li>
  								<li>Add more Here</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Goals</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Knowledge sharing - we're taking on more important design principles and thinking about accessibility within our designs for SystmOne. This opportunity to knowledge share with the Communications Team can benefit the relationship between the Design Team and Communications team, opening a channel for potential work in the future. </li>
								<li>This can benefit the whole user experience not just for staff in the patient record but for patient leaflets and other touchpoints that patients will directly interact with.</li>
								<li>Produce a brand identity that supports the values of the Trust and is flexible across different mediums.</li>
								<li>Support and organise a multi-disciplinary team to deliver designs with meaning that expresses the values of the Trust </li>
								<li>Provide a cost benefit to the Trust through completing this work with in-house skills and resources.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<hr>
							
							<h2>My Role & Contribution</h2>
								<p>The proposal for this design work developed following a period of consultation I had personally organised with the communications team to discuss accessibility on the trust website and colour scheme. After receiving the proposal to make a new brand identity, I drew up a business case file to explain the details, project background and approach to the Head of Design & Solutions. Once this was approved, I was able to assemble a team of UX Designers/UX Researchers with previous branding/graphic design skills to complete this project. I then proceeded to organise tasks, due dates and follow up meetings to move the project forward efficiently.</p>

							<h1>Beta Phase</h1>

									<h3>Final Design Proposal</h3>
										<p>The graphical devices of circles and streaks used within Idea #2 have their own unique meaning. The circles represent our service users, playing on the term "Circle of Life". Circles often represent balance, since they contain two halves joined together—the yin-yang signifying duality and harmony. The phrase "Circle of Life" can be often used to describe the full spectrum of healthcare services provided, from birth to end-of-life care. It signifies the NHS's commitment to delivering comprehensive and universal healthcare services that address the needs of individuals at every stage of their lives, ensuring access to quality care regardless of age, background, or medical condition. The "circle of life" concept underscores the NHS's mission to support the health and well-being of the entire population throughout their lifetimes. This design inspiration alludes to the marketing phrase coined by the Communications team “for a better life”.</p>

							<h2>Outcome & Handover</h2>
										<p>Design proposal has been accepted by the Chief Executive Office (see feedback below). Plans are being developed to implement the design across the Trust (digital and print touchpoints). The next steps will be to produce a brand guide to outline the usage details for the new designs. This will include, accessibility rules, use of language, use of colours, correct construction of the design, breakdown of design application to different touchpoints. I will be continuing to work alongside the Trust’s communications team in the future to support the embedding of the new branding created.</p>
										<p>How did we measure success?</p>

										<h3>Feedback from Clientele</h3>
												<p>SABP - Director of Communications - “I just wanted to praise your UX team for doing some really excellent work, at speed, on our brand. Their creativity, underpinned by expertise in accessibility issues, blew us away. They had also clearly listened really well to the brief, which is a rare skill. The resulting work was worthy of an expensive design agency. I don’t often take the time to write emails congratulating teams, but this was hugely deserved. Please let them know just how much I appreciate their efforts. I plan to nominate them for a Staff Award.”</p>
												<p>SABP - Head of Communications - “I wanted to give you an update on the new branding you have created for the Trust which Marcel has now shared with Graham Wareham (CEO) and Helen Rostill (Chief Executive Director of Therapies). They were both very impressed with your work and very happy to sign off on the design.”</p>

							<h2>What I learned from this project</h2>
									<h3>What I learned</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Organising a team to produce work in a quick turnaround and to communicate efficiently to understand who is performing what role.</li>
											<li>Experience in presenting a design proposal, covering accessibility, meaning behind designs, their purpose and to align the designs to achieve the aspirations of the client.</li>
											<li>Keeping design proposals brief and to the point, preventing overcomplication and misunderstanding.</li>
											<li>How to provide designers with inspiration to apply themselves within a project and to use their creativity and imagination.</li>
										</ul>	
									<h3>What I can do to improve</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>If more time was available for this work, I would have explored the values of the Trust more thoroughly. This would help build an understanding of the experience of a service user and a staff member and how this can be reflected and represented in the branding.</li>
											<li>To take the opportunity to use research resources, gather a statistical understanding of how different design options produce different experiences. Apply statistical analysis to design reasoning, making sure the designs have credible backing and reasoning behind decision making.</li>
