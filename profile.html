							<h1>Profile</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>My name is Sam Cornish and I am an experienced, senior, UX designer with skills and backgrounds in graphic design and branding. I am formally educated in Graphic Design as I have achieved both a Bachelor and Masters degree from University Centre Farnborough and Arts University Bournemouth respectively. My experience has taught me discipline and I have developed an excellent eye for detail. I also pride myself on being available to and supportive of others that I work with. I believe it is hugely important to foster and develop working relationships especially in the design sector as so many roles involve working within a design team.</p>
							<p>Using Agile/scrum methodology</p>
							<p>Producing this website myself, experience in using html and css</p>
							
							<p>My personal passions include</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Sport, both playing it and watching it, is one of my key passions. I have been playing football since the age of 4 and organised teams at home and university. I support Reading FC and avidly follow the Premier League. I'm also a very keen golfer with a membership at a local club. I'm playing off 18 with a goal to bring this down further!</li>
									<li>Cooking (or attempting to cook) has always been something I have enjoyed. Although I mainly enjoy eating food cooked by a professional!</li>
								</ul>
